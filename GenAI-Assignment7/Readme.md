## Assignment7: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Problem Statement:
You are working as a Python Developer for an online electronics store. The company wants to organize product information, billing operations, and service management using Object-Oriented Programming.

##  In this assignment the Topics Covered:
Classes & Objects
Attributes & Methods
Constructors (__init__)
Encapsulation (private/protected attributes)
Inheritance
Polymorphism (method overriding)
Abstraction (simple base class)
Magic Methods
Operator Overloading

## Restrictions:
Keep class structures clean and simple.
Do NOT use advanced patterns, file operations, or exceptions (beyond simple logic).
Stick strictly to OOP fundamentals.


### Task 1:Basic Class & Object Creation

Create a class Product with:
Attributes: name, price, category
Method: get_info() → prints product details
Create two objects and call get_info().
Extra (optional): Add a method apply_discount(percent) that returns the discounted price.


### Task 2: Constructor & Encapsulation

Modify the Product class:
Make price a private attribute (__price).
Create getter & setter methods:
get_price()
set_price(new_price) → should update only if new_price > 0
Test modifying price using the setter.


### Task 3: Inheritance (Single-Level)

Create a subclass ElectronicProduct that inherits from Product.
Additional attribute:
warranty_years
Override the get_info() method to include warranty info.
Create an object and demonstrate inheritance + overriding.


### Task 4: Polymorphism

Create two classes:
Laptop(Product)
Mobile(Product)
Both override:
def get_info(self):

# Print details in their own style
Write a loop that iterates over objects of Laptop and Mobile and calls get_info() on each to show polymorphism.


### Task 5: Abstraction (Using Abstract Base Class)

Create an abstract class Payment with abstract method:
process_payment(amount)
Then create two subclasses:
CreditCardPayment
UPIPayment
Both override process_payment() with simple print statements.
Test all classes.


### Task 6: Magic Methods & Operator Overloading

Add the following to your Product class:

1. __str__ method
Returns a readable string:
Product(name, price, category)

2. Operator Overloading (__add__)
Allow:
product1 + product2
To return the total combined price.
Test this with two product objects.


### Task 7: Mini Project: Simple Inventory System (OOP Only)

Create two classes:

Class: Inventory
Attributes:
products → list to store product objects

Methods:
add_product(product)
remove_product(name)
get_total_value() → sums prices of all products
show_all_products() → prints info for each product

Class: Store
Attributes:
store_name
inventory → an Inventory object

Methods:
add_new_product() → takes input & creates Product object
show_summary() → prints total items & value

Important: Use only OOP concepts — no file handling, no exceptions, no packages.

# Test the system by:
Creating a Store object
Adding 3 products
Showing summary
Using __add__ to combine prices of two products


## How to Run
1. Install Python.
2. Open the project folder.
3. Run each codecell separately.


## Conclusion
This assignment helps in understanding (oops concepts) and this Assignment7 every task is very very good especially Task 7 i worked 2 to 3 hours on this task only
